# Development Report for Daily Dues Project

I'm beginning this document on Thursday, 2025-09-04, after spending "a while" on the "thinking" phase and then doing the first real coding on Sunday, 2025-08-24. That was pretty minimal - moving some example code around, moving a few files, renaming a file or two, and deleting some experimental stuff that didn't work out. 

Anyway, all that to say that this file is a distilled chronicle - maybe better called a summary - of what actually took place during development (which, at this point, is still in full swing).
