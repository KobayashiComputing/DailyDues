## GitHub Credentials Test
Somehow my system added a new GitHub HTTPS user (31042207) with an unknown (to me) password. I looked for how to fix that by using Bing to search for "vs code has two github usernames how to fix" and found a helpful [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEse8loLffM)

The process:
1. Open Control Panel
2. Choose "User Accounts"
3. Choose "Credendtials Manager"
4. Click on "Windows Credentials"
5. Search the list for "git:https://" in the left hand column
6. Identify the culprit
7. Double check you have the corrent one!
8. Click the "Remove" link for the errant credential
