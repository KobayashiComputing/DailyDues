***A Task Tickler with Time Tracker.***
***(Or is it a Time Tracker with Task Tickler?)***

A helper for managing (and remembering) things that need to be done on a recurring basis, and also tracks the amount of time spent on each. The recurring basis might usually be daily, but it could be weekly, or monthly, or periodically at some other interval.
